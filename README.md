# EE_224_Project
A course project to design and implement a 16 bit CPU in VHDL. Fondly called, "IITB-CPU" can handle 15 instructions - Arithmetic and Logical, Load and Store, Jump. 
Components of the CPU include : 16 bit ALU, Register File(8 registers, including Program Counter), A Memory Unit, and Temporary Registers. 
<br>
The FSM consists of 20 states. We present two implementations of the CPU: Substates, and One-State One-Clock.
